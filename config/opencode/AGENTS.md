# General Guidelines

- Minimize blast radius. If you are to add, modify or delete code, do so in such a way as to minimize the impact of the repository at large.
- Do not touch the code unless there is a plan in place. If there is no plan, generate a plan first.
- Do not run commands that require sudo.
- If a process that you launch asks for sudo, immediately kill the process and provide a message to the user. You must await the user for instructions on how to proceed.

## Traits
