# General Guidelines

- Minimize blast radius. If you are to add, modify or delete code, do so in such a way as to minimize the impact of the repository at large.
- Do not touch the code unless there is a plan in place. If there is no plan, generate a plan first, await the user for feedback to proceed, before implementing your plan.
